# Course 4 - Employer Project for the Bank of England (Final Grade: pending)

Project Details: This final 6 week project for the LSE course gave myself and six students the opportunity to work together in a collaborative project aimed at providing strategic insights to The Bank of England. It served as a quasi internship as there was frequent contact and presentations to The Bank itself. The focus was on speech data sentiment scores and any potential correlation to economic indicators. This project had a significant scope so, unlike previous assignments, my personal involvement was specifically in the exploratory sentiment data analysis, predictive modelling (Gradient Boosting Regression) and data visualision expert.

Project Scenario: Part of the job of the Bank of England is to provide reassurance and stability to financial markets. One way this is achieved is through representatives of the Bank delivering speeches at various public events. As an organisation, the Bank of England is interested in how the trends in these speeches correlate with observed events and economic indicators, as well as how the sentiment of these speeches can be used to predict market behaviour. This analysis will inform our understanding of the impact of the Bank’s communications on the economy, as well as the predictive power of using this data set.

This analysis considered the following business questions:

**1. Has the sentiment of central bank speeches changed over time? If so, how has it changed?**

**2. How does the sentiment of the Bank of England’s speeches correlate with key Events?**

**3. How does the sentiment of speeches correlate with key economic indicators of the UK?**

**4. Do these speeches have any predictive power to assist in predicting market behaviour?**

**5. Are there other insights or findings from the analysis that may be of interest to the organisation?**

**6. What are the potential reasons for any of the correlations discovered above? How have you drawn these conclusions?**

**Professional Development and Impact:**
This project showcased my intepersonal communication skills through working with a group of people I have never previously worked with. I was also able to take on a predictive modelling task (Gradient Boosting Regression),  aswell as as a bespoke financial sentiment model which was not covered in the programme. Finally, a genuine passion for predictive analytics was cemented in the exploration of the business questions, a passion which I would love to be able to explore further.
